<p><span><strong>Honors Thesis</strong>, <em>University of Utah</em>. 2015—present</span><br />
<span>Senior thesis, supervised by Dr. Gordan Savin, that develops a quaternionic analogue of the classical correspondence between lattices in the plane and quadratic forms. In progress.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Research in Industrial Projects</strong>, <em>HKUST</em>. June—August 2015</span><br />
<span>With three other undergraduates, developed an Android mobile application to recognize logos, using convolutional neural networks. Developed the data collection and experiment framework; assisted with mobile development; optimized natural language processing code of another team. National Science Foundation funded program run by the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Random Graphs</strong>, <em>University of Utah</em>. January—May 2015</span><br />
<span>Implemented several numerical optimization techniques to investigate the performance of an algorithm to match two different graphs by adjusting their Laplacian spectra through addition/removal of edges. Studied spectral graph theory and random graph models (BTER, CL, Erds-Rényi).</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Inverse Problem of Breakdown</strong>, <em>University of Utah</em>. Fall 2014</span><br />
<span>With four undergrads in a research class, studied the inverse problem of determining, from external measurements, the internal electric/elastic breakdown of an <em>inhomogeneous</em> object. Extended results from PI’s previous papers on another inverse problem to our setting, obtaining tight, necessary bounds on the electric field of an object which has not broken down.</span></p>
